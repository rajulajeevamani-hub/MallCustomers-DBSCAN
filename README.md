* Introduction to DBSCAN on Mall Customers Dataset

The Mall Customers dataset contains customer demographic information such as Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score. Businesses often use this dataset to segment customers into groups for targeted marketing strategies.

Traditional clustering methods like K-Means require the number of clusters to be defined in advance, but in real-world customer data, the number of natural groupings may not be known. This is where DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) becomes useful.
